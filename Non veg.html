            <p>Variations on the flavor are gained by adding root vegetables such as parsnip, potato, sweet potato and celery root; herbs such as bay leaves, parsley and dill; other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves, lettuce, or tomatoes; and black pepper.[4][5] The soup should be brought slowly to a boil and then simmered in a covered pot on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. Saffron or turmeric are sometimes added as a yellow colorant.</p>

            <h3><b>Chicken Wings</b></h3>
            <img src="../chicken wings.jpg"  width="300" height="200" >
            <p>There are three types of wings you'll find at the market: the whole wing, the flat, and the drumette (the latter being the part that looks like a mini-drumstick). When you see these two parts together, it's easy to imagine the wing of a bird. Before the wing is broken apart, the drumette comes attached to the breast. Chicken wings also have a wing tip, but those aren't often included in sectioned-off bits of the cut.</p>
