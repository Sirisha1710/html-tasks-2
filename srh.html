            <p>Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) is an Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket team based in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. Hereâ€™s a brief history of the team:
                Founding: SRH was founded in 2012 after the Hyderabad-based Deccan Chargers were terminated by the IPL. The franchise was taken over by the SUN Group1.
                Early Success: The team made their first IPL appearance in 2013, reaching the playoffs and finishing in fourth place. SRH won their maiden IPL title in 2016, defeating Royal Challengers Bangalore in the final1.
                Consistent Performances: Between 2016 and 2020, SRH qualified for the playoff stage for five consecutive seasons. In 2018, they reached the finals but lost to Chennai Super Kings1.
                Recent Years: The team has seen some struggles in recent years, particularly after 2021, which included a public falling out with David Warner, who had been a key player for the team2.
                Leadership: As of the latest season, the team is coached by Daniel Vettori and captained by Pat Cummins1.
                SRH is known for its strong bowling side, often admired for its ability to defend low totals. However, they have also shifted to become a remarkable batting side, according to many cricket pundits1. David Warner is the leading run-scorer for the side, having won the Orange Cap three times, and Bhuvneshwar Kumar is the leading wicket-taker, having won the Purple Cap twice.</p>
